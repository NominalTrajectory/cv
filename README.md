This is my CV/resume made using LaTeX - a professional document creation tool. LaTeX helps create clean, well-formatted documents with consistent styling.

## About LaTeX

LaTeX (pronounced "Lay-tech" or "Lah-tech") is a document preparation system widely used in academia and professional settings. Unlike traditional word processors, LaTeX uses plain text and markup tags to define the document's structure and styling, resulting in consistently beautiful and professional output.
