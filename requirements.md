Build my new CV using LaTeX. I have the following requirements:

- It must be on a single A4 page.
- It must use only well-maintained LaTeX packages.
- It must be possible to use external fonts (e.g. from Google Fonts).
- It must be possible to use custom colors.
- It must contain a revision at the bottom corner containing git commit hash (short) of the current commit.
- The structure must be clean, simple, and easy to read.
- The design of the CV must be "a super minimalistic CV with a modern, futuristic aesthetic that reflects a passion for computers, technology, and innovationâ€”clean, balanced fonts, sleek dividers with a hint of futuristic design (perhaps inspired by Go programming symbols), and a subtle, tech-forward color scheme."
